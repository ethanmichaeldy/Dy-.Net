.NET - framework for building apps on Windows. 
     - F# and VB.NET can use this too.
     - consists of...

1. CLR - Common Language Runtime. 
       - Made by Microsoft, inspired by Java.
       - Compile to intermediate language.
       - CLR app runs in the background & translates IL code to Machine code (Just-In-time application)

2. Class Library
.NET Architecture
 - The app is built with Classes.
 - ie. Containers with Attributes and Methods.
 - A Namespace is a container for related classes.
 - An Assembly is a container for related namespaces.
    - Can be executables or Dynamically Linked libraries (DLLs)
 - Compiling an app compiles one or more assemblies.
